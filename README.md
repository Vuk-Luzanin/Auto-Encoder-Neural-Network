# Autoencoder for Denoising Tissue Images

This project demonstrates the use of a convolutional autoencoder to denoise tissue images. The autoencoder learns to reconstruct clean images from noisy inputs, which are artificially generated by adding random noise to clean images.

## Overview

In this project, we use tissue images as the dataset. The task is to train a convolutional autoencoder to remove random noise from images. We simulate noisy images by adding Gaussian noise to clean images and then train the autoencoder to denoise them. The process involves creating a model, training it, and visualizing the results.

### Key Features:
- **Custom Dataset**: The dataset consists of tissue images with added noise for the purpose of denoising.
- **Autoencoder Model**: The autoencoder model uses Convolutional layers to encode and decode the images.
- **Image Denoising**: Random noise is added to the images, and the autoencoder learns to remove the noise.

## Requirements

Make sure to have Python 3.x installed. The following libraries are required for this project:

- TensorFlow (for model creation and training)
- Numpy (for data manipulation)
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- OpenCV (for image processing)
- Keras (for preprocessing images)
- TQDM (for progress bars)

To install the dependencies, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib opencv-python keras tqdm
